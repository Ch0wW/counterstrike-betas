***** "Defusion" C4 bombing description *****

If a map has a target to be bombed, the terrorist team leader will be equipped with a C4 bomb. His goal is to plant the bomb at
the defined bomb target (marked on the map by a red target decal). Once the bomb has been planted, the bomb will blow up in X
seconds (where X is the server defined C4 timer variable, default at 30 seconds). The bomb will make an increasingly louder 
beeping sound as it nears the detonation time. After the bomb has been planted, any Counter-terrorist player equipped with a bomb
defuser may defuse the bomb by crouching on top of the bomb for 5 seconds. If the bomb goes off and the target is hit, the round will
end and the Terrorists will win. If the bomb has been planted and all the terrorists are eliminated, the round will not end until
the bomb has either been defused (CT wins) or detonated (Terrorist wins). A bomb's blast radius is fairly substantial and it's wise
to give yourself 10 seconds to run away from the bomb once it's been planted.

NOTE : Only half the CT team is equipped with bomb defusers.. It is recommended that this half of the team stay near the bomb targets
to listen for any beeping sounds.

Deufusion maps are denoted by de_mapname

-------------------------------------------------------------------



Counter-Stike is a modification (MOD) to the excellent game, Half-Life. It modifies the multiplayer aspects of Half-Life to bring to it a more team-oriented gameplay. Not terribly unlike Team Fortress2, Counter-Strike provides the player with an experience that a trained counter-terrorist unit or terrorist unit experiences. 

The MOD is team-based featuring one team playing the role of the terrorist and the other team playing the role of the anti-terrorist. Each side has access to different guns and equipment, as well as different abilities. Maps will have different goals such as: hostage rescue, assasination, kill the entire opposing force, etc. 

Weapons include the usual assortment of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, grenades, demolition devices. Each side has access to a different subset of weapons so it may be the case that only the counter-terrorist can use the M4A1, and only the terrorists can use the AK-47.

We are confident that we've created a MOD quite unlike any other, that is still fun to play and free damnit!
