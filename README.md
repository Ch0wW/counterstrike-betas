# List of all Counter-Strike Betas 

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/P5P27UZHV)

This repository contains most of the official releases of Counter-Strike Pre-1.6, for preservation purposes. Installer files have already been extracted without any modification.

If possible, Linux binaries are also provided, avoiding the need to redownload files twice, or to search for them. In addition to that, all versions of Counter-Strike contains a `README.md` file providing all the informations you need, such as the recommended release of Half-Life to run these mods, or the changelog if given.

Each folder of Counter-Strike has been renamed to properly differenciate them from a community standpoint with the exception of very specific builds of Counter-Strike (CS 1.1b/c, CS 1.0b), or serverside-only fixes (CSBeta 6.6a, 6.6b, 6.8 => `csbeta66`).

# Versions branches

# Retail

All retail versions of Counter-Strike work with HL 1.1.1.0 or as a Steam Mod for HL1 (requires modifications).
