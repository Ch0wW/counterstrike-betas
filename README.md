# Counter-Strike Beta 1.1

This version has been taken from the Internet, since there's no official installer around, only a zipped archive.

I am unsure of what was officially changed, so I only took the modified `mp.dll` and changed the folder name.

## Supported versions
- [x] **Windows**
- [ ] Linux (missing server binaries)

## Recommended Half-Life / HLDS version to play
- Windows: Half-Life v1.0.1.6
