This repository contains most of the official releases of Counter-Strike Pre-1.6, for preservation purposes. Installer files have already been extracted without any modification.

If possible, Linux binaries are also provided, avoiding the need to redownload files twice, or to search for them. In addition to that, all versions of Counter-Strike contains a `README.md` file providing all the informations you need, such as the recommended release of Half-Life to run these mods, or the changelog if given.

Each folder of Counter-Strike has been renamed to properly differenciate them from a community standpoint with the exception of very specific builds of Counter-Strike (CS 1.1b/c, CS 1.0b), or serverside-only fixes (CSBeta 6.6a, 6.6b, 6.8 => `csbeta66`).

# Version branches

# Releases

# Betas

Depending on the beta, it is recommended to use Half-Life 1.1.1.0 (or Steam, with the exception of 6.5 that requires modifications in order for clients to make it run), and Half-Life 1.0.1.6 if you're running Beta 6.2 or below.
