Misc 6.0 Notes:
---------------
Assassination Gameplay: One member of the CT team will serve as the VIP.
The object is to get the VIP safely to the pre-defined escape points. If he
dies, the CT's lose the round. If he makes it safely, the CT's win. VIP has
a unique skin, only carries a knife, and has ample body armor. Certain
weapons cannot be purchased by each team in this gameplay scenario.

Escape Gameplay: The T team starts out in a fortified location and must
"escape" to one of the pre-defined escape points. The CT's must exterminate
them before they can escape. The T's win the round once 50% of the team has
successfully escaped. They can also break into the armory to steal weapons,
or just get out of there. The two teams will switch roles after every 8
rounds of play.

After buying NVG, you toggle it on/off by using the "nightvision" command. Be
warned that the NVG will not be effective on every hardware setup. It may or not
work well for you.

To switch between right and left hand weapons, go to:
multiplayer > Customize > Advanced Options
There will be a checkbox for you to select the hand of your choice.
