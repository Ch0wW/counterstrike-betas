*** COUNTERSTRIKE ***


Description/Gameplay :
Counterstrike is a teamplay based mod that allows players to play as terrorists or as counter-terrorists. The game is played in rounds where each team starts off in different locations of the map and work together to achieve a common goal. For the counter-terrorists, this goal is to rescue hostages and/or wipe out the entire terrorist force. The terrorists are responsible for preventing either of the above from happening. Since the game is played in rounds (of 8 minutes each), when a player dies, he/she will not respawn until one or both teams are wiped out. Money is earned for killing players on opposing teams and for rescuing hostages. Bonus money is also awarded to all the players on the team that wins a round. The following describes how much money is awarded/deducted for a given action :

- Rescuing a hostage { $500 }
- Killing an enemy { $200 }
- Killing a hostage { - $850 }
- Killing a teammate { - $500 }

End of Round Bonuses :
- $200 * Number of Hostages rescued { applies to Counter-terrorists only }
- $250 * Number of Hostages kept { applies to Terrorists only }

*Note : Round Bonuses are awarded to ALL members of a team. It is in the counter-terrorists best interests to rescue as many hostages as possible or else the terrorist side will keep racking up money (as long as they win the round).



Installation :
	To install the game, unzip the file CSTRIKE.ZIP into a directory called "cstrike" under your Half-Life directory. Once that's done type :
"hl -game cstrike" to run the game as a client OR
"hlds -game cstrike" to set up a dedicated server running Counterstrike.
Once in the game, it is IMPORTANT that you type "exec cstrike.cfg" at the console. This will make available some important new slots for you.
Once you've installed the game we HIGHLY recommend that you download Gamespy (www.gamespy.com) and use our custom Gamespy tab (Counterstrike.qst)


New Commands :
	There are several new commands which you must bind in order to play Counterstrike properly. These commands are as follows :

'buyweapon' : This command will bring up a menu where you can buy new weapons. You can only carry one primary gun (eg. Shotgun) at a time as well as one secondary gun (eg. pistols).
'buyammo' : This command will bring up a menu where you can buy extra ammo for your guns. Please pay attention to the corresponding gun names when buying ammo. You don't want to look foolish by buying buckshot for you G3/SG-1 rifle.
'buyitem' : This command will bring up a menu where you can buy some new items. Currently, there are only two new items you can buy : Kevlar vest (highly recommended) and flashbang grenades.
'showplayerinfo' : This command will display how much money a player has in his account as well as show what team the player is on.
'hostage' : When the counter-terrorists have brought the hostages back to any one of their spawn points, this command will "rescue" the hostages.
'chooseteam' : When the teams become uneven, this command will allow a player to switch teams (be warned switching teams will result in a suicide).
'throwweapon' : This command is useful for when you kill someone and you want to pick up his gun. In order to do so, you must enter this command (to drop your primary gun) and pick up the dead man's gun.

*Note the first three commands only work near a players spawn points (ie. Each side can only buy new equipment near their base).



Miscellaneous Tips :

- When a player joins a server, he is assigned a default team.
- If you put your crosshair over a player for a second, his name will appear in the lower right corner of the screen.
- Teams can be distinguished on the scoreboard by the colour of the players names. Terrorists are written with red text whereas the Counter-terrorists are written with white sex.
- Accuracy of the weapons are affected by whether or not the player is ducking/standing/running.
- Flashbang effects are minimized if you turn away from the flashbang before it explodes.
- Kevlar vests are an important tool but bear in mind they don't protect your head.



Final Notes :

- Please bear in mind this is an early beta version with copious amounts of bugs. The only reason it's being released at this stage is because we feel it is playable and somewhat fun already. Work is being constantly done on the mod and hopefully we can release a final version sometime before Team Fortress 2 or Quake3 comes out.
- Please do not email us regarding beta testing of future versions. We have our internal beta testers who do a fine job of spotting bugs and annoying the hell out of us (as well as providing the occasional beta leak).
- PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE Do not use any of the models contained within this mod in another mod. We worked very hard on the models and would be very disappointed if people used our models in their work (saving themselves a good 6 months worth of modelling).
- We are aware of the difficulty in differentiating between the two teams and thus we are devoted to bringing you many more player models in future versions. Not only that but we aware that some of you hate the fact that the models are left handed (cause I'm left handed) and are looking high and low for an easy way to mirror the models (that doesn't involve re-animating them). Please stop dissing us for those two points. We have soft emotions.
